## 📐 Design Rationale Document

- **Design Choices:**  
  The platform features a clean, minimal interface with intuitive navigation and prominent call-to-action buttons, ensuring users can easily access key features. Floating cards highlight core metrics, instantly building trust and credibility. The layout is modular, making future enhancements straightforward.

- **Color Scheme & Typography:**  
  A dark background with vibrant gradients (primary blue, purple, and green) creates a modern, professional look while ensuring strong contrast and accessibility. The Inter font family is chosen for its clarity and readability, supporting a polished and consistent user experience.

- **User Experience Considerations:**  
  The UI is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to all devices. Subtle animations (fade-in, bounce) enhance interactivity without overwhelming users. Accessibility best practices are followed, including semantic HTML and sufficient color contrast, to ensure inclusivity for all users.
